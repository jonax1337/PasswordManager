## 🛡️ Security & Privacy (The Important Stuff)

### 🔒 **How We Keep You Safe**

**Encryption**: We use **AES-256** encryption - the gold standard used by banks, governments, and militaries. This means even if someone gets your database file, it would take longer than the age of the universe to crack it without your master password.

**Zero Knowledge**: We literally cannot see your passwords. Ever. The encryption happens on your device, and we never get the keys.

**Offline First**: Your passwords never touch the internet unless you choose to sync them yourself. No cloud accounts, no servers, no data collection.

**Open Source**: Security experts can examine our code to verify we're doing everything correctly. No "trust us" required.

### 🏠 **Your Data Stays Yours**

| **What** | **Where It Lives** | **Who Can Access It** |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Your master password | Only in your memory | Only you |
| Your password database | Your computer only | Only you (with master password) |
| App usage data | Nowhere - we don't collect it | Nobody |
| Your personal info | Your device only | Only you |

### ⚠️ **Important Security Reminders**

- **Your master password is everything** - if you lose it, nobody can help you recover your data
- **Backup your database file** to secure locations (USB drive, encrypted cloud storage, etc.)
- **Use a strong, unique master password** - consider using a passphrase with multiple words
- **Keep the app updated** - security improvements happen regularly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**❌ App won't start**
- Make sure you downloaded the right version for your operating system
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or check security settings (macOS)
- Disable antivirus temporarily to see if it's blocking the app
- Download the latest version - older versions might have compatibility issues

**❌ Can't open my database**
- Double-check your master password (it's case-sensitive!)
- Make sure the .pmdb file isn't corrupted - try copying it to your desktop
- Restart the app and try again
- If you're sure about your password but it's not working, the file might be damaged

**❌ App is running slow**
- Large databases (1000+ entries) might need a moment to load
- Try restarting the app
- Make sure you have enough free disk space
- Close other resource-heavy applications

**❌ Import isn't working**
- Make sure your KeePass file isn't corrupted by opening it in KeePass first
- Try exporting a smaller test database to troubleshoot
- Check that you're using the correct password for the import file

### Contributing Guidelines

**🐛 Bug Reports**
- Use the GitHub issue template
- Include OS, app version, and reproduction steps
- Add console logs if available (but redact sensitive info)

**💡 Feature Requests**
- Describe the use case and expected behavior
- Consider backward compatibility
- Think about security implications

**🔧 Pull Requests**
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Test on multiple platforms if possible
- Update documentation for new features

### Technology Choices & Rationale

**Why Electron?** Cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies, mature ecosystem, secure architecture with context isolation.

**Why React?** Modern, performant UI library with excellent developer experience and strong ecosystem.

**Why CryptoJS?** Battle-tested encryption library with AES-256 support and good performance characteristics.

**Why Tailwind?** Utility-first CSS framework enables rapid UI development and consistent theming.

**Why Local Storage?** Maximum security and privacy - no cloud dependencies, user controls their data completely.

### Performance Considerations

The app is optimized for large databases with several techniques:

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Only renders visible entries (50+ entry threshold)
- **Memoization**: Heavy calculations cached with useMemo/useCallback
- **Index Maps**: O(1) lookups for entries and folders by ID
- **Batch Updates**: Drag & drop operations use direct array manipulation
- **Throttled Events**: Scroll and resize events use requestAnimationFrame

### Security Architecture

- **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- **Key Management**: Master password never stored, keys derived on-demand
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data cleared after use where possible
- **Process Isolation**: Renderer process sandboxed with context isolation
- **No Network**: App functions completely offline by design
