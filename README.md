## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Download the latest release for your platform:

- **Windows**: Download the `.exe` installer
- **macOS**: Download the `.dmg` package
- **Linux**: Download the `.AppImage` file

[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/jonax1337/simple-password-manager/releases)

### First Use

1. **Launch the application**
2. **Create a new database** or import from KeePass
3. **Set your master password** (this is the only password you'll need to remember)
4. **Choose where to save** your encrypted database file
5. **Start adding your passwords** with the built-in generator

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Security Architecture
Your passwords are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before being saved to disk. The master password you choose is used to derive the encryption key, which means even if someone gains access to your database file, they cannot read your passwords without your master password.

### Database Format
All data is stored in encrypted `.pmdb` files that contain:
- Your password entries with usernames, URLs, and notes
- Folder structure for organization
- Entry metadata like creation and modification dates

### Offline Operation
The application works completely offline. No internet connection is required, and your data never leaves your device unless you choose to back it up yourself.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**
- Download the correct version for your operating system
- Check if antivirus software is blocking the application
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or check security settings (macOS)

**Cannot open database**
- Verify your master password is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check that the database file hasn't been corrupted
- Try copying the file to a different location

**Import not working**
- Ensure the KeePass file opens correctly in KeePass first
- Verify you're using the correct password for the import
- Try importing a smaller test database first
