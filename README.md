[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/jonax1337/simple-password-manager/releases)

### First Use

1. **Launch the application**
2. **Create a new database** or import from KeePass
3. **Set your master password** (this is the only password you'll need to remember)
4. **Choose where to save** your encrypted database file
5. **Start adding your passwords** with the built-in generator

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Security Architecture
Your passwords are protected by multiple layers of security:

**Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations) and unique salt per database. This makes brute-force attacks computationally infeasible.

**Key Derivation**: Your master password is never stored. Instead, it's used with PBKDF2 to derive the encryption key on-demand, with a unique salt for each database.

**Brute-Force Protection**: The application tracks failed login attempts and implements progressive lockouts:
- 1-2 failed attempts: Warning displayed
- 3-5 failed attempts: Temporary lockout (5-30 seconds)
- 6-9 failed attempts: Extended lockout (1-30 minutes)
- 10+ failed attempts: Permanent database lockout

**User-Specific Locking**: Security tracking is tied to the user running the application. If one user locks a database, other users on the same system can still access it with the correct master password. This prevents one user from accidentally locking out others from shared databases.

**Attack Persistence**: Security tracking survives application restarts and system reboots, preventing attackers from bypassing protections by restarting the app.

### Database Format
All data is stored in encrypted `.pmdb` files that contain:
- Your password entries with usernames, URLs, and notes
- Folder structure for organization
- Entry metadata like creation and modification dates
- Cryptographic salt for enhanced security
- Version information for future compatibility

**Security Storage**: Failed attempt tracking is stored separately in an encrypted security file, preventing tampering while maintaining your privacy.

### Offline Operation
The application works completely offline. No internet connection is required, and your data never leaves your device unless you choose to back it up yourself.

## üìñ User Guide

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| New database | `Ctrl+N` |
| Open database | `Ctrl+O` |
| Save | `Ctrl+S` |
| Add entry | `Ctrl+Alt+Win+N` |
| Search | `Ctrl+F` |
| Password generator | `Ctrl+G` |
| Close/Cancel | `Escape` |

### Importing from KeePass

1. **Create a new database** or open an existing one
2. **Click "Import from KeePass"** in the welcome screen
3. **Select your .kdbx file** and enter the password
4. **All entries and folders** will be imported automatically

## üîß Advanced Features

### Themes and Customization

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Master Password
- Use a strong, unique master password (16+ characters recommended)
- Consider using a passphrase with multiple words
- Never share your master password with anyone
- Keep it in a secure location if written down
- **Remember**: After 10 failed attempts, your database will be permanently locked

### Backup Strategy
- **Regular backups** of your `.pmdb` file
- **Multiple backup locations** (USB drive, encrypted cloud storage)
- **Test backups** periodically to ensure they work
- **Keep backups secure** with the same care as your main file
- **Security files**: Don't backup the security tracking files (they reset protections)

### Password Generation
- **Use the built-in generator** for all new passwords
- **Enable all character types** for maximum security
- **Use long passwords** (16+ characters when possible)
- **Generate unique passwords** for every account
- **Monitor password strength** with the built-in entropy calculator

### Understanding Database Lockout

**How Lockout Works**:
The application protects against brute-force attacks by tracking failed login attempts for each database file. When you enter an incorrect master password repeatedly, the system implements progressive lockouts:

1. **Attempts 1-2**: Simple warning with remaining attempts shown
2. **Attempts 3-5**: Short lockouts (5-30 seconds) to slow down attacks
3. **Attempts 6-9**: Extended lockouts (1-30 minutes) for persistent attacks
4. **Attempt 10+**: Permanent lockout - database becomes inaccessible

**Important**: The lockout is **user-specific** and tied to your user account on the computer. If you lock a database, other users on the same system can still access it with the correct master password.

**Security File Location**: 
The lockout information is stored in an encrypted security file in your application data folder:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Roaming\simple-password-manager\security.encrypted`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/simple-password-manager/security.encrypted`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/simple-password-manager/security.encrypted`

### Lockout Recovery
If your database becomes permanently locked:
1. **Locate the security file**: The exact path is shown in the lockout message
2. **Close the application** completely
3. **Delete the security file** (usually `security.encrypted` in app data folder)
4. **Restart the application** - lockout will be reset
5. **Use correct master password** to avoid re-lockout

**Recovery Examples**:
```bash
# Windows (Command Prompt)
del "C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Roaming\simple-password-manager\security.encrypted"

# macOS/Linux (Terminal)
rm ~/.config/simple-password-manager/security.encrypted
```

**Important Notes**:
- Deleting the security file resets ALL lockout protections for ALL databases
- Other users on the same computer are not affected by your lockout
- Keep your master password secure to avoid lockouts entirely
- The database file itself is never damaged - only access is restricted

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**
- Download the correct version for your operating system
- Check if antivirus software is blocking the application
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or check security settings (macOS)

**Cannot open database**
- Verify your master password is correct (case-sensitive)
- Check that the database file hasn't been corrupted
- Try copying the file to a different location
- **Check for lockout**: Look for security warnings in the login screen

**Database permanently locked**
- **Don't panic**: Your data is safe, just protected from brute-force attacks
- **User-specific**: Only affects your user account - others can still access the database
- **Find security file**: Look for the path shown in the error message
- **Delete security file**: Remove `security.encrypted` from app data folder
- **Restart app**: Lockout protection will be reset for all databases
- **Use correct password**: Be extra careful to avoid re-lockout

**Import not working**
- Ensure the KeePass file opens correctly in KeePass first
- Verify you're using the correct password for the import
- Try importing a smaller test database first
